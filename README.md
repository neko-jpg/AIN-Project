## 🚀 Project Overview

AI Navigator (AIN) is an innovative AI-powered project planning platform that helps users discover the optimal technology stack and implementation plan for their AI projects through three unique interaction modes:

### 🎯 Three Revolutionary Modes

1. **対話モード (Dialog Mode)** - Classic AI conversation for step-by-step guidance
2. **ボールモード (Ball Mode)** - Interactive visual discovery through interest mapping
3. **木モード (Tree Mode)** - Structured project planning with dependency visualization

## ✨ Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Advanced AI recommendations based on user requirements
- **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Three different ways to explore and plan projects
- **Real-time Proposal Generation**: Instant technical stack suggestions
- **Interactive Refinement**: Conversational improvement of proposals
- **Beautiful UI/UX**: Production-ready design with smooth animations
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all devices

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Markdown**: React Markdown with GitHub Flavored Markdown
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python
- **AI**: Google Gemini API
